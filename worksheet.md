# Morse Code Virtual Radio

This tutorial will show you how to connect a Morse key to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, and how to write code to play tones when you hold the key down. You will also decode the Morse that you're keying so that it comes up on the screen.

## What is Morse Code?

Invented by Samuel Morse in 1836, Morse Code is a method for sending and receiving text messages using short and long beeps. Conventionally, a short beep is called a **dot** and a long one is a **dash** (also known, respectively, as a **dit** and a **dah**). Every letter of the alphabet has a unique sequence of dots and dashes.

If you look at the chart below, the letter **A** is beep beeeeeep and the letter **B** is beeeeeep beep beep beep.

![](images/morse.png)

- All timings are defined as multiples of one dot length
- A dash is three times the length of a dot
- Each dot or dash has a short gap of silence after it (usually 1 dot length)
- Letters in a word have a slightly longer gap of silence between them (usually 3 dot lengths)
- Words have an even longer gap of silence between them (usually 7 dot lengths)

You don't necessarily need to use sound for this, although this is the most common way Morse Code was used. You can do it with anything that can be turned on and off; this could be a torch, raising and lowering a flag, or even just blinking your eyes quickly and slowly. This makes it one of the most versatile forms of telecommunication. There is even a formal international treaty which enshrines the Morse Code for SOS `... --- ...` (Save Our Souls) as a universal distress signal.

In the 1890s Morse Code was adapted for use with early radio before it was possible to send and receive voice. This was done by simply sending pulses of a carrier wave at an agreed frequency. The recipient's radio would then just play an audible tone whenever the carrier was received. It was used extensively during both World Wars and is still used to this day by amateur radio operators.

There are three essentials to using Morse:

- Knowing the code
- Being able to key it in
- Being able to decode it when listening

The choice of the dot and dash combination for each letter is not random. Samuel Morse based his decision on how often letters occurred in the English language used by his local newspaper. The more commonly-used a letter was, the fewer dots and dashes he chose, thereby making it faster to key in.

The chart below is the Morse Code tree, and is really helpful when listening and decoding; you might want to print it out and keep it in front of you. You can see that **E** and **T** are the most common letters. So you start at the top, go to the left if you hear a dot and to the right if you hear a dash. You can double-check this against the first chart: try it now for the letters **A** and **B**.

Get a pencil and paper and see how you get on with this: [listen to slow Morse Code](sounds/slow_morse.mp3). Don't be intimidated if you find following the code hard; it's always tricky to start with. As with many things, the more you do it the easier it gets.

## Play a test beep

First boot up your Raspberry Pi and log in.

As this exercise involves noise, you should use headphones if you are in a classroom environment, to avoid distracting others around you. If you are using headphones or a speaker on the Raspberry Pi, you will need to run the following command to redirect sound to the headphone socket:

```bash
sudo amixer cset numid=3 1
```

First, we need some code to make the tone sound. Enter the following command to start editing a blank file (please note that you should use Python 3 for this project):

```bash
nano morse-code.py
```

Now either copy and paste or enter the following code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import pygame
import time
from array import array
from pygame.locals import *

pygame.mixer.pre_init(44100, -16, 1, 1024)
pygame.init()

class ToneSound(pygame.mixer.Sound):
    def __init__(self, frequency, volume):
        self.frequency = frequency
        pygame.mixer.Sound.__init__(self, self.build_samples())
        self.set_volume(volume)

    def build_samples(self):
        period = int(round(pygame.mixer.get_init()[0] / self.frequency))
        samples = array("h", [0] * period)
        amplitude = 2 ** (abs(pygame.mixer.get_init()[1]) - 1) - 1
        for time in range(period):
            if time < period / 2:
                samples[time] = amplitude
            else:
                samples[time] = -amplitude
        return samples
```

You don't need to worry about the inner workings of this code, but, if you are interested, the code inherits one of the `pygame` sound classes, and automatically generates the wave data for playing a tone at a specified frequency.

Don't worry if you've never seen a Python [class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29) before. A class is like a blueprint of code that you can re-use multiple times. An instance of a class is known as an [object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

Typical Morse Code tones are somewhere between 400 Hz and 1000 Hz; in this project, we will use a frequency of 800 Hz. In this code, `tone_obj` is the object that has been created from the blueprint `ToneSound`.

Add the following code to the very bottom of the file:

```python
tone_obj = ToneSound(frequency = 800, volume = .5)

tone_obj.play(-1) #the -1 means to loop the sound
time.sleep(2)
tone_obj.stop()
```
Press `Ctrl + O` then `Enter` to save followed by `Ctrl + X` to quit.

Next, mark the file as executable with the following command:

```python
chmod +x morse-code.py
```

Now we can run the code; when you do, you should hear a nice two-second-long beep:

```python
./morse-code.py
```

If you didn't hear anything then double-check everything is plugged in correctly. If you're using the headphone jack of the Pi, remember that you'll need to use the command `sudo amixer cset numid=3 1` to redirect the audio. You may notice the tone sounds a bit wobbly at the start; this is just an artefact of `pygame` starting up and using up CPU cycles. Subsequent tones will sound correct.

## Connect the Morse Code key to the GPIO pins

All Morse Code keys work in a similar way to a push button or switch. They have two screw terminals, to which a positive and a negative wire are attached. When you press the key down, two bits of metal touch, causing a circuit to complete. The effect would be the same if you just touched the two wires together.

To connect the Morse key to the GPIO pins, we need to do a bit of physical computing. GPIO pins can be set up as an input or an output. Output mode is used when you want to supply voltage to a device like an LED or buzzer. If we use input mode instead, a GPIO pin has a value that we can read in our code. If the pin has voltage going into it, the reading would be `1` (HIGH); if the pin was connected directly to ground (no voltage), the reading would be `0` (LOW). 

The goal is to use the Morse Code key to switch voltage on and off for a GPIO pin, thus making the reading of the pin change in our code when we press the key.

When a GPIO pin is in input mode the pin is said to be floating, meaning that it has no fixed voltage level. That's no good for what we want, as the pin will randomly float between HIGH and LOW. For this project, we need to know categorically whether the key is up or down. So we need to fix the voltage level to HIGH or LOW, and then make it change only when the key is pressed. We can do this in two ways.

### A pull up circuit

Wire the GPIO pin to 3.3 volts through a large 10kΩ resistor so that it always reads HIGH. Then we can short the pin to ground via the Morse key, so that the pin will go LOW when you press it.

  ![](images/pull_up.png)

### A pull down circuit

  Wire the GPIO pin to ground through a large 10kΩ resistor so that it always reads LOW. Then we can short the pin to 3.3 volts through the Morse key, so that it goes HIGH when you press it. When the key is pressed there is a lower resistance path to 3.3 volts, and therefore the pin will read HIGH. 

  ![](images/pull_down.png)
  
Note: The 1kΩ R2 resistor is there in both circuits to give the GPIO pin a fail-safe protection, in case we mistakenly set the pin to be in OUTPUT mode.

Fortunately, the Raspberry Pi has all the above circuitry built in and we can select either a pull up or a pull down circuit in our code for each GPIO pin. This sets up some internal circuitry that is too small for us to see. So you can get away with just using two jumper wires here, although you're welcome to wire it up the way shown above if you wish. Let's use GPIO pin #4 as an example:

### Pull up configuration

  GPIO pin #4 will be wired to 3.3 volts using the internal pull up resistor, so that it always reads HIGH. Then we can short the pin to ground via the Morse key, so that the pin will go LOW when you press it.

  ![](images/pull_up_key.png) 

### Pull down configuration

  GPIO pin #4 will be wired to ground using the internal pull down resistor, so that it always reads LOW. Then we can short the pin to 3.3 volts via the Morse key, so that the pin will go HIGH when you press it.

  ![](images/pull_down_key.png) 

Both methods will work equally well; which one people use is often just personal preference. Take the two jumper wires and screw the male ends into the terminal blocks on your Morse Code key. On some very old antique keys this can be a tricky operation.

![](images/jumper_wires_key.png) 

Choose the pull up or down configuration you want to use and connect the female ends to the appropriate GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi; use the above diagrams as a guide. Make a note of which configuration you're using as you'll need to incorporate it into your programming later. **In this worksheet, the examples given use a pull up configuration: you may use a pull down configuration if you wish, but remember that you will have to alter your code accordingly**.

## Detect the key position through the GPIO pin value

Enter the following command to edit our previous tone program:

```bash
nano morse-code.py
```

To give us access to the GPIO pins in our code, we need to import the `gpiozero` library.

Add `gpiozero as gpio` to the `import` line at the top so that it reads:

```python
import pygame
import time
from RPi import GPIO
```

At the bottom remove these lines (they will be put back in again later):

```python
tone_obj.play(-1)
time.sleep(2)
tone_obj.stop()
```

Either copy and paste or enter the code below. Pay attention `key = gpio.Button(pin, pull_up=True)` line. This assigns the variable `key` to an *instance* of the class `gpio.Button`. The `gpio.Button` class holds all the important information about how to read inputs from the button, and comes with some *methods*, which are like functions, but are attached to the instance of the class, and can access its internal variables.

It also tells the class to set GPIO pin 4 as input, then set the internal pull up resistor on it. If you want to use the pull down resistor, you'll need to use `pull_up=False` instead.

Then, there is then a `while` loop, which continually reads the state of GPIO pin 4 and prints `ON` or `OFF` to the screen every second.

```python
pin = 4
key = gpio.Button(pin, pull_up=True)

while True:
    reading = key.is_pressed
    print("ON" if reading else "OFF")
    time.sleep(1)
```

Press `Ctrl + O` then `Enter` to save followed by `Ctrl + X` to quit.

If you've set the `pull_up` parameter to the right value, the program should show OFF when the key is up. Hold it down for a few seconds and it will show ON. The output should look something like this:

```bash
OFF
OFF
OFF
ON
ON
ON
OFF
OFF
OFF
```

If it is the other way round (it shows `ON` when the key is up and vice-versa), change the value of the `pull_up` parameter, then retry.

Press `Ctrl + C` to quit.

## Play a tone when the key is down

We've now proven that the value of the GPIO pin is changing when we press the Morse key, so the electronics is done. But our code is still very basic. All we have is a loop that keeps polling the pin; the code doesn't actually respond to the press or release of the key yet. You'll notice that you can press and release the key many times within one second.

For our Morse Code virtual radio to work, we need our program to respond every time the user presses or releases the key, by starting and stopping the tone sound. The `Button` class we created earlier already has a couple of methods to hold up the execution of your code until the key has been pressed or released. The overall goal here would be the following algorithm:

- Loop
  - Wait for key down
  - Start playing tone
  - Wait for key up
  - Stop playing tone

To wait for the press, we use two methods built into the `Button` class called `wait_for_press` and `wait_for_release`, which will make the Pi sleep until the pin state has changed. In order to have a good response time, we only need to sleep for a very short amount of time for each iteration of the loop: 0.01 seconds is ideal.

Have a look at the code below. Remember that this is for a pull up configuration; if you're using a pull down configuration, change the part that says `gpio.Button(pin, pull_up=True)` to `gpio.Button(pin, pull_up=False)`.

```python

tone_obj = ToneSound(frequency = 800, volume = .5)

pin = 4
key = gpio.Button(pin, pull_up=True)

print("Ready")

while True:
    key.wait_for_press()
    tone_obj.play(-1) #the -1 means to loop the sound
    key.wait_for_release()
    tone_obj.stop()

```

Enter the following command to edit our previous program:

`nano morse-code.py`

Leave the `ToneSound` class at the top of your program, scroll to the bottom, delete the previous `while` loop code and then add the code above. Remember to make the necessary modifications if you are using a pull-down configuration.

Press `Ctrl + O` then `Enter` to save followed by `Ctrl + X` to quit.

You can now test your code.

```bash
./morse-code.py
```

After the you see the `Ready` message, you should be able to start keying in your first Morse Code messages. Test the Morse key to make sure that the tone is only ever on when the key is down, and off when the key is up. If you've got it the wrong way around, check again to see if you have the `pull_up` parameter set correctly.

Now have a go at a short word. Early Nokia mobile phones used the Morse Code for SMS when a text message arrived. This is a really easy one to do; the Morse Code for SMS is `... -- ...`. Try keying in other words using the chart at the top.

Press `Ctrl + C` to quit.

## Decode the Morse as you go

What will really help you learn is having a way to know when you're getting the code right or wrong. We can program the Pi to decode what you're keying in and then print the letters to the screen as you go. With this you can pick a message, try to key it in and immediately see if the correct text is being displayed. If the wrong text comes up then it's likely that you didn't key in the correct Morse Code sequence. Practice makes perfect!

To program this, we should remind ourselves about the rules of International Morse Code:

- All timings are defined as multiples of one dot length
- A dash is three times the length of a dot
- Each dot or dash has a short gap of silence after it (usually 1 dot length)
- Letters in a word have a slightly longer gap of silence between them (usually 3 dot lengths)
- Words have an even longer gap of silence between them (usually 7 dot lengths)

So to start with, we need to tell the difference between a dot and a dash. We can do that by timing how long the key is held down for to give us the length of the tone. Then we need to tell the difference between the dots and dashes making up one word and the next. To do that, we can time how long the key is up for, so we're measuring the gap of silence between the tones. The same measurement of time will also give us the difference between letters making up a word and separate words.

### Distinguish dot and dash

First, we need to program the Pi to recognise the difference between a dot and a dash.

The aim is to time how long the key is held down for. Generally speaking, a dot is about 0.15 seconds or less and anything longer than this is a dash. You're welcome to use a different value if you wish but 0.15 seconds is a good starting point. The way to time something in code is to record the time now, wait until something has happened, and then subtract the time you recorded from the current time.

Take a look at the code below; notice the the use of the `key_down_time` and `key_down_length` variables.

```python

tone_obj = ToneSound(frequency = 800, volume = .5)

pin = 4
key = gpio.Button(pin, pull_up=True)

DOT = "."
DASH = "-"

key_down_time = 0
key_down_length = 0

print("Ready")

while True:
    key.wait_for_press()
    key_down_time = time.time() #record the time when the key went down
    tone_obj.play(-1) #the -1 means to loop the sound
    key.wait_for_release()
    key_down_length = key_up_time - key_down_time #get the length of time it was held down for
    tone_obj.stop()

    if key_down_length > 0.15:
        print(DASH)
    else:
        print(DOT)
```

Enter the following command to edit our previous program:

```bash
nano morse-code.py
```

Scroll to the bottom and add the lines shown above that are missing from your original code. If necessary, modify the code for a pull down configuration. When you're done press `Ctrl + O` then `Enter` to save followed by `Ctrl + X` to quit. You can now test your code.

```bash
./morse-code.py
```

Use the Morse key to make some long and short tones. You should see dots and dashes appearing at the moment when you release the key. The output will look something like this:

```
.
.
.
-
-
.
.
.
```

Press `Ctrl + C` to quit.

### Translate Morse Code into text

Next, we need a way to combine these dots and dashes to form letters and words. This is actually a little more tricky than it sounds. Consider how we're going to know when the user has finished keying in a letter and when they have finished a word. The correct behaviour will be the following:

- When they finish keying in a letter, display the letter
- When they finish keying in a word, display a space character

The following code should make this easier, by allowing you to take a string of dots and dashes and look up the corresponding letter of the alphabet. Enter the following command to download this code:

```bash
wget https://goo.gl/aRjulj -O morse_lookup.py --no-check-certificate
```

Now let's have a look at it. Enter the command below to edit the file:

```bash
nano morse_lookup.py
```

The `morse_code_lookup` variable is a Python dictionary object. A dictionary works using keys and values; for every key there is a corresponding value. You could create a dictionary to translate between, say, English and French. In this case, if the key was "Hello", the value would be "Bonjour". Look at the code below as an example:

```python
english_to_french = {
    "Hello": "Bonjour",
    "Yes": "Oui",
    "No": "Non"
}
    
print(english_to_french["Hello"])
```

The result of the above code would be: `Bonjour`.

We're going to use this technique to translate between the sequence of dots and dashes and their corresponding letter. For example, `-.-.` is the letter `C`. The `try_decode` function at the bottom can be used to check that a dot-dash sequence is valid and, if so, translate it into the corresponding letter.

Press `Ctrl + X` to quit from editing without saving.

### Multithreading 

Here, we need to introduce a new programming concept called [multithreading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_%28software%29#Multithreading). A thread in a program is a single sequence of instructions that are being followed by the computer at any one time. In most simple programs there is only one thread, which is the main one. But it is possible to have multiple threads going at the same time: this is like making a program pat its head and rub its stomach at the same time.

Because our main thread is always held up by the `wait_for_keydown` and `wait_for_keyup` functions, we need to have another thread which can constantly do the work of decoding what the user is keying in.

The overall goal here will be to modify the main thread so that it stores every dot and dash in a buffer list. The decoder thread will then be watching independently for different lengths of silence. A short gap of silence denotes a new letter, so the thread will use the `try_decode` function to see if the buffer contents matches a letter; it will also empty the buffer. If the gap of silence gets longer, this denotes a new word and a space character would be shown.

### Add the code

Now let's go back to editing our main program. Enter the following command:

```bash
nano morse-code.py
```

Firstly, we need to add two new variables. `key_up_time` is to record when the key was released so that the length of silent gaps can be measured in our code. The other is called `buffer`; this is a list which will temporarily hold the dots and dashes before a full word is complete.

```python
key_up_time = 0
buffer = []
```

Add these variables to your code as shown below. There are also two new lines to add inside the main `while` loop: a line which sets `key_up_time`, and another that appends to the `buffer` list. Make sure you add both of them.

```python
key_down_time = 0
key_down_length = 0
key_up_time = 0
buffer = []

print("Ready")

while True:
    key.wait_for_press()
    key_down_time = time.time() #record the time when the key went down
    tone_obj.play(-1) #the -1 means to loop the sound
    key.wait_for_release()
    key_up_time = time.time() #record the time when the key was released
    key_down_length = key_up_time - key_down_time #get the length of time it was held down for
    tone_obj.stop()
    buffer.append(DASH if key_down_length > 0.15 else DOT)
```

Double-check that your code is the same as the above. When you're done, press `Ctrl + O` then `Enter` to save. We're not finished editing, yet, though; do not run the code as it is. We still need to add code for the new thread.

First we need to add some new imports to the top of our file. Scroll up to the top and find the `import` lines. We need to add the `Thread` class, from the `threading` module, to do multithreading and `from morse_lookup import *` to give us access to the lookup code we downloaded earlier. The code should now look like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import pygame
import time
import gpiozero as gpio
from threading import Thread
from array import array
from pygame.locals import *
from morse_lookup import *
```

Next, let's put in the code that will run on our separate thread. To do this, you can just define a function and this will be what is run on that thread. Add this function to your code just below the `ToneSound` class:

```python
def decoder():
    global key_up_time
    global buffer
    new_word = False
    while True:
        time.sleep(.01)
        key_up_length = time.time() - key_up_time
        if len(buffer) > 0 and key_up_length >= 1.5:
            new_word = True
            bit_string = "".join(buffer)
            try_decode(bit_string)
            del buffer[:]
        elif new_word and key_up_length >= 4.5:
            new_word = False
            sys.stdout.write(" ")
            sys.stdout.flush()
```

The first thing you'll notice is the use of the `global` keyword. This will give the thread access to the `key_up_time` and `buffer` variables that belong to the main thread, so that they can be used here. Next, we have a variable called `new_word`. Once the end of the word has been detected we set this to `False`, so that we don't keep putting more spaces down.

We then have another `while True` loop; the main purpose of this is to continually monitor the gaps of silence between tones. You'll see there is a `sleep` command to avoid overloading the CPU; then we calculate the `key_up_length`, which is the `key_up_time` from the main thread subtracted from the current time. Every time around the loop, which is every 0.01 seconds, the `key_up_length` value will increase as long as the Morse key stays up.

Next is an `if` statement. There are two conditions upon which we need to act here:

1. When there is something in the `buffer` and the gap of silence is big enough to mean a new letter. We're hard-coding the value of `1.5` seconds for this. If this situation happens we know we're in a new word, so we set the `new_word` variable to `True`. The line `bit_string = "".join(buffer)` is taking the dots and dashes in the `buffer` list, and turning them into a single string that might be something like `.-..`. We can then see if that matches a key in the Morse translation dictionary via the `try_decode` function. The `try_decode` function displays the result. We then empty the buffer, ready for the next word, with `del buffer[:]`. If we didn't do this, the buffer would keep getting bigger, and would never match any letters in the `morse_lookup.py` dictionary.

2. When the gap of silence has increased to `4.5` seconds. Remember that a rule of Morse is that the gap of silence for a new word has to be three times the length of the gap that denotes a new letter: `1.5 x 3 = 4.5`. So here we set `new_word` to False, so that the `else if` condition no longer succeeds, and then put down a space character.

Note that the use of `sys.stdout` is so that we can print to the screen without having to always show a new line, as with the default `print` command.

The choice of `1.5` and `4.5` seconds is essentially arbitrary, but these gaps are about right for someone who is new to Morse, who will be going quite slowly. As your skill improves, you may wish to reduce these numbers in your code. 

Press `Ctrl + O` then `Enter` to save. There is one more thing we need to do before we can run our code, which is to add a line of code that will launch the new thread. This has to be done from the main thread, so scroll down and find the `print("Ready")` line. Add the lines below just before it:

```bash
decoder_thread = Thread(target=decoder)
decoder_thread.start()
```

The final code should look like the example below; remember to make the necessary changes if you're using a pull down configuration instead of pull up. 

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import pygame
import time
import gpiozero as gpio
from threading import Thread

from morse_lookup import *

    def __init__(self, frequency, volume):

        self.set_volume(volume)

    def build_samples(self):
        period = int(round(pygame.mixer.get_init()[0] / self.frequency))

        if len(buffer) > 0 and key_up_length >= 1.5:

            try_decode(bit_string)
            del buffer[:]
        elif new_word and key_up_length >= 4.5:
            new_word = False
            sys.stdout.write(" ")
            sys.stdout.flush()

tone_obj = ToneSound(frequency = 800, volume = .5)

pin = 4
key = gpio.Button(pin, pull_up=True)

DOT = "."
DASH = "-"

key_down_time = 0
key_down_length = 0
key_up_time = 0
buffer = []

decoder_thread = Thread(target=decoder)
decoder_thread.start()

print("Ready")

while True:
    key.wait_for_press()
    key_down_time = time.time() #record the time when the key went down
    tone_obj.play(-1) #the -1 means to loop the sound
    key.wait_for_release()
    key_up_time = time.time() #record the time when the key was released
    key_down_length = key_up_time - key_down_time #get the length of time it was held down for
    tone_obj.stop()
    buffer.append(DASH if key_down_length > 0.15 else DOT)
```

When you're done, press `Ctrl + O` then `Enter` to save, followed by `Ctrl + X` to quit. You can now test your code. 

```bash
./morse-code.py
```

Wait for the `Ready` message to show and then begin keying Morse Code in. The trick is to watch the screen and wait for a letter to appear before you start keying in the next one. You may wish to refer to the charts at the top of this page.

SOS is `...` `---` `...`

Hello is `....` `.` `.-..` `.-..` `---`

The output should look like this:

```
SOS HELLO 
```

Press `Ctrl + C` twice to quit.

You can ignore the message saying `Unhandled exception in thread`; this is just the child thread being terminated when you send the `KeyboardInterrupt` with `Ctrl + C`.

## Play a listening game with a friend

Now that you have a way to verify the correctness of your keying, you can play a listening game with a friend.

The other person should:

- Have a printout of the Morse Code tree
- Some paper, a pencil, and an eraser
- Be able to hear your Morse tones
- Not be able to see your screen

The aim of the game is to key in a message and see if the other person can decode it using just their ears. This is how it was done during both World Wars. It's trickier than it sounds so go slowly and start off with just letters, then progress onto words and messages. The other person should write down on some paper what they think is being keyed in; when the message is finished you can compare what they wrote down to what was shown on the screen.

Try not to write dots and dashes; instead try to get into the zone of listening to the tones, following the tree and arriving at a letter. Record the letters instead of the code. If the message sounds like gibberish when you're decoding just keep going; the person behind the screen could be making mistakes. The aim is for you to have exactly what is shown on their screen, even if it's wrong.

## What next?

- Why not extend the decoding ability of this project to include punctuation characters like the full stop `.-.-.-`, comma `--..--` and question mark `..--..`?  
- You could try to decode Morse in other languages. To do this you will need to edit the file `morse_lookup.py` and add the dictionary entries as appropriate. A comprehensive reference for International Morse can be found [here](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.1677-1-200910-I/en), covering English, French, Arabic, Chinese and Russian.
- You could explore Morse Code extensions: these are special procedural characters that mean things like wait, end of message or message part separator. You can find more information on these extensions [here](http://ke1g.org/media/uploads/files/MorseExtension.pdf).
- You could take your Morse Code knowledge further with the [Koch Method](http://www.qsl.net/n1irz/finley.morse.html), a tried and tested way to learn Morse by listening at 15 to 20 words per minute. There is also an existing [Python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/KochMorse/0.99.7) which provides a Gtk2 style interface that you could install and use.
- Can you work out how to modify the timing numbers we hard coded to enable you to use your `morse-code.py` project to key in at 15 to 20 words per minute? Try changing the `key_up_length` in the `decoder_thread` function.
